# Hey!
I'm Jake and this is my GitHub. I'm from Nottinghamshire, England.

I am a Student studying Electronic Engineering at the University of York, I enjoy music and programming.

I enjoy learning new things and I am always looking to learn more. I am also interested in learning more about the world of computers. I have access to GitHub Copilot to help me learn more about Programming and I am a Artic Vault Contributor.

I have attended some hackathons including Durhack 2023, HackNotts 2023 and 2024 and Reading Hackathon 2022

I have organised a Capture the flag competition event for schools across Northen Ireland called [IglooCode](https://iglooco.de) with others at Queens University Belfast sponsored by Kainos and Liberty IT and developed the Capture the flag platform

I am confident with Python, C, C#, C++, Java, Javascript/Typescript, Go, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, Unity and Assembly
